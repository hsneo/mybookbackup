=======================================
2011-07-07  Hock Sik   To develop scripts to automate the copy of files during the plugging-in 
                       of an external hard drive

Introduction.
*************
Here is a script written in bash and easily understood. This is an improvement from last time we did a similar 
rsync script using Perl. 

The bash script does the below 
a. create the backup directory if it does not exist
b. use rsync to copy files and sub-directories from the source directory to the destination 
c. Those sync to an external hard drive are captured in mybookbackup.log 
d. email the run result to user


Note
****   
a. How to Mount an NTFS Filesystem
   As of CentOS 5.4 (kernel 2.6.18-164 or newer), the fuse kernel module is included in the kernel itself. 
   If the rpmforge repo is disabled by default, yum --enablerepo=rpmforge install fuse fuse-ntfs-3g 

   Edit /etc/fstab to add in the below ntfs mountpoint for an external hdd 
   LABEL=/media            /media                  ntfs-3g rw,umask=0000,defaults 0 0
   
   Further information is available at http://wiki.centos.org/TipsAndTricks/NTFS

b. If the option=log-file is not supported by rsync,    
   please download the latest version of rsync from http://packages.sw.be/rsync/ to support the option=log-file

c. How to gather udev info on the external hard drive
   Use the command: udevinfo -a -p $(udevinfo -q path -n /dev/sdb1)

   THe udev info can be used to define rules in a rules file.
 
   Set the permission privilege of the rules file by using the command: chmod 644 95-mybookbackup.rules

   The info can be found at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=168221.

d. The script needs to be made executable by using the command: chmod 755 mybookbackup.sh



Installation
************
Place the rules file named 95-mybookbackup.rules under  /etc/udev/rules.d

It will tell system to find and run an executable script.
